Introduction to Programming
Thonny, a Python IDE for beginners
Introduction to Google Colab (and topic modelling, while we&rsquo;re at it!)
Programming Historian: Python Introduction and Installation. &ldquo;This first lesson in our section on dealing with Online Sources is designed to get you and your computer set up to start programming. We will focus on installing the relevant software – all free and reputable – and finally we will help you to get your toes wet with some simple programming that provides immediate results.&rdquo;
Programming Historian: Introduction to the Bash Command Line. &ldquo;This lesson will teach you how to enter commands using a command-line interface, rather than through a graphical interface. Command-line interfaces have advantages for computer users who need more precision in their work, such as digital historians.&rdquo;
Programming Historian: Introduction to the Windows Command Line with PowerShell. &ldquo;This tutorial will introduce you to the basics of Windows PowerShell, the standard command-line interface for Windows computers.&rdquo;
Programming Historian: Setting up an Integrated Development Environment for Python (Linux). &ldquo;This lesson will help you set up an integrated development environment for Python on a computer running the Linux operating system.&rdquo;
