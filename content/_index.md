# Digital Methods Accelerator

Welcome to the Digital Methods Accelerator toolkit. This is an open resource, curated by the Sussex Digital Humanities Lab. It's very early stages at the moment, but the ambition is an accessible resource hub for DH+, in other words, all kinds of things at the intersection of digital technologies and media, arts and humanities, aimed especially at researchers. Start with the site index on the Home page to browse strands, areas, and practices.
