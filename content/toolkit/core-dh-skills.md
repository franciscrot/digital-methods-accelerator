## Data work {#data-work}

Data work covers how humanities data is collected, cleaned, and described so it can be responsibly analyzed. It emphasizes provenance, documentation, and the ways data practices shape what can be known, especially in the context of bias and exclusion.

<details>
<summary>Resources</summary>
- Data cleaning / data wrangling
- Regular Expressions
- Metadata
- What's the difference between a data set and a database?
- Digital forensics
</details>



## Text & cultural analytics {#text-cultural-analytics}

Text and cultural analytics explore computational approaches to studying language and cultural patterns at scale ("at scale" means there's lots of data - for examples, thousands of books that you wouldn't be able to read in the time available). 

<details>
<summary>Resources</summary>

- Topic modelling
- Embeddings
- Distance reading and close reading
</details>

## Networked culture {#networked-culture}

Networked culture examines how people, texts, and platforms connect and circulate. It combines network analysis with attention to power, mediation, and the politics of digital infrastructures.

<details>
<summary>Resources</summary>

- Network analysis
- Citation graphs
</details>

## Digital collections {#digital-collections}

Digital collections focus on building and maintaining collections that support research, teaching, and public access. 

<details>
<summary>Resources</summary>

- Creating digital collections
- Omeka
- Building a static website on GitHub Pages
- Digitisation workflows
</details>

## Data collection {#web-methods}

Scraping the web is one important way of collecting data. Other forms of data collection include conducting interviews, deploying microphones or other sensors to record activities, giving participants prompts or challenges or inviting them to participate in playful activities, autoethnographic reflection, etc.

## Physical computing {#physical-computing}

Physical computing connects digital research to material devices and environments. It foregrounds how sensors and embedded systems shape the data we collect and how that data relates to place and lived experience.

- Sensors

## Visual methods {#visual-methods}

Visual methods explore how graphics and diagrams support interpretation and argument in the humanities. They focus on clarity, rhetoric, and the responsibilities of visual storytelling with data.

- Data visualisation
- Exploratory vs explanatory graphics

## Development foundations {#development-foundations}

Development foundations introduce collaborative practices that make digital projects sustainable. Version control and shared workflows support transparency, accountability, and collective scholarship.

- Collaborating on GitHub

## Spatial {#spatial}

Spatial methods use geographic tools to analyze place, movement, and spatial narratives in the humanities. They also consider how mapping choices can reinforce or challenge historical and cultural power relations.

## Digitisation {#digitisation}

Digitisation converts physical materials into digital forms that can be searched, analyzed, and shared. It includes attention to accuracy, labor, and the limits of automated recognition in cultural contexts.
