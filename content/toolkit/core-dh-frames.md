# Core DH Frames

## Critical lenses {#critical-lenses}

- Feminist, queer, decolonial, and anti-racist approaches
- Actor–Network Theory (ANT), Science and Technology Studies (STS), and relational ontologies
- Political economy and infrastructure studies (platforms, labour, supply chains, energy)
- Just transition and climate justice perspectives
- Minimal computing and low-resource, low-carbon approaches
- Critical disability studies and accessibility
- Participatory research, co-design, co-development, co-creation, etc.

## Data lifecycle {#data-lifecycle}

The data lifecycle describes how data moves through a research project, from creation or collection to long-term care and reuse.

- Acquire
- Transform
- Analyse
- Disseminate
- Sustain

## Formats, standards, etc. {#formats-standards}

- "Mark-up" often means adding information to a text that explains what parts of it are, in a way a computer can understand. For example, HTML marks up how content is displayed on the web (headings, paragraphs, links); XML marks up the underlying structure and meaning of data in a flexible, machine-readable way; and TEI is a specific scholarly XML standard for marking up literary and historical texts in rich, interpretive detail.
- XML – a structured way of marking up text so computers can tell what different parts *are* (e.g. titles, dates, names)
- XSLT / SQL – XSLT reshapes XML documents into new forms; SQL asks questions of databases (e.g. “show me all items from 1850”)
- JSON – a simple format for storing and transmitting structured data
- Python – a beginner-friendly language for reading, cleaning, and analysing data
- SPARQL – a query language for linked data across the web
- TEI – a scholarly XML standard for encoding literary and historical texts in detail
- IIIF – a shared framework for libraries and museums to deliver high-resolution images online so they can be viewed, compared, and reused across sites
