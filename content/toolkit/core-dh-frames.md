## Formats, standards, etc. {#formats-standards}

- "Mark-up" often means adding information to a text that explains what parts of it are, in a way a computer can understand. - For example, HTML marks up how content displayed on the web (headings, paragraphs, links); XML marks up the underlying structure and meaning of data in a flexible, machine-readable way; and TEI is a specific scholarly XML standard for marking up literary and historical texts in rich, interpretive detail.
- XML – a structured way of 'marking up' text so computers can tell what different parts ARE (e.g. titles, dates, names)
- XSLT / SQL – XSLT reshapes XML documents into new forms; SQL asks questions of databases (e.g. “show me all items from 1850”)
- JSON - a simple format for storing and transmitting data
- Python - Python is a beginner-friendly language for reading, cleaning, and analysing data.
- SPARQL - SPARQL queries linked data across the web
- TEI - a scholarly XML standard for encoding literary and historical texts in detail.
- IIIF – a shared way for libraries and museums to deliver high-resolution images online so they can be viewed, compared, and reused across sites.
